    <!-- Instructions on how to make Item-->
            <li>Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water, and let stand for 5 minutes, or until foamy. </li>
            <p></p>

            <p></p>

            <li>In a large bowl, mix together the yeast mixture, milk, sugar, salt, eggs, shortening, and 2 cups of the flour. 
                Mix for a few minutes at low speed, or stirring with a wooden spoon. 
                Beat in remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough no longer sticks to the bowl. 
                Knead for about 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. 
                Place the dough into a greased bowl, and cover. 
                Set in a warm place to rise until double. 
                Dough is ready if you touch it, and the indention remains. </li>

            <p></p>

            <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, and gently roll out to 1/2 inch thickness. 
                Cut with a floured doughnut cutter. 
                Let doughnuts sit out to rise again until double. 
                Cover loosely with a cloth. </li>

            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. 
                Stir in confectioners' sugar and vanilla until smooth. 
                Remove from heat, and stir in hot water one tablespoon at a time until the icing is somewhat thin, but not watery. 
                Set aside. </li>

            <li> Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large heavy skillet to 350 F&deg; (175 C&deg;). 
                Slide doughnuts into the hot oil using a wide spatula. 
                Turn doughnuts over as they rise to the surface. 
                Fry doughnuts on each side until golden brown. 
                Remove from hot oil, to drain on a wire rack. 
                Dip doughnuts into the glaze while still hot, and set onto wire racks to drain off excess. 
                Keep a cookie sheet or tray under racks for easier clean up.</li>

    <!-- Bonus Tip if any -->

            The exact amount may vary depending on cook time and temperature, ingredient density, and the specific type of oil used.</p>
