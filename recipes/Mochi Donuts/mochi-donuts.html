        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><h4>What Is a Mochi Donuts?</h4></p>
        <p>These homemade Mochi Donuts are crispy on the exterior with a light, fluffy interior, which maintains that mochi chew. They are not too sweet, which is how we like our donuts.</p>

        <p><h4>How to Make Mochi Donuts Step-by-Step:</h4></p>
        <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make Mochi Donuts at home:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type:disk;">
    <!-- Instructions on how to make Item-->
            <li>Combine rice flour, tapioca flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. 
                Beat on low speed until combined, 1 minute. 
                Add milk, butter, vanilla, and egg; beat on low speed until a smooth dough forms about 1 to 2 minutes (dough will be slightly sticky). </li>

                <p><img src="mixing.jpg"alt="Mixer mixing ingredient in a bowl"></p>
            <li><p>Lightly dust rice flour onto a clean work surface and turn dough onto surface. 
                Divide dough into quarters and working in batches, roll dough quarters into 18-inch-long ropes about 1-inch wide.</p></li>

            <li>Cut each rope into 1-inch pieces. 
                Roll each piece into a ball, wetting hands as needed to help roll (about 72 each for 9 donuts).</li>

                <p><img src="cubing.jpg"alt="Slicing the dough into squares"></p>
            <li>Cut 9 square pieces of parchment paper, 5x5-inches, and place in a single layer on a baking sheet. 
                Arrange 8 dough balls onto each piece parchment in a ring about 3 1/2 inches in diameter, connecting them side by side and using water to seal together. </li>

                <p><img src="balling.jpg"alt="Balling up dough"></p>
            <li><p> Oil to a depth of 2 inches in a large Dutch oven;
                 heat over medium-high to 350 F&deg; (175 C&deg;). </p></li>

            <li><p> Place 3 dough rings, along with parchment, in hot oil. 
                Remove parchment with tongs once dough floats to top of oil. 
                Cook until golden and puffed, turning once halfway through, 2 to 3 minutes. 
                Transfer to a wire rack lined with paper towels; cool 10 minutes. 
                Repeat with remaining dough rings.</p></li>

            <li><p> For the glaze whisk powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons milk, and vanilla together in a medium bowl. 
                Mixture should be the consistency of heavy cream; add up to 1 tablespoon milk, 1 teaspoon at a time, as needed to adjust consistency. 
                Dip tops of 4 or 5 doughnuts into the glaze; place on wire rack (with paper towel removed).</p></li>
                <p><img src="frying.jpg"alt="Frying donuts"></p>

            <li>Stir 2 teaspoons dried fruit powder into remaining glaze. 
                Dip remaining doughnuts in the glaze; transfer to wire rack and sprinkle with remaining fruit powder.</li>
